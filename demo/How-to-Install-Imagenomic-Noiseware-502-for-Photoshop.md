## What is noise and why does it matter?
 
Noise is a term used to describe the random variations of brightness and color in digital images. It can be caused by various factors, such as the sensor quality, the ISO setting, the exposure time, the lighting condition, and the post-processing. Noise can degrade the image quality and make it look grainy, blurry, or distorted.
 
Reducing noise can improve the clarity, contrast, and detail of your images. It can also make them more suitable for printing, sharing, or editing. However, reducing noise too much can also remove some of the natural texture and sharpness of your images. Therefore, it is important to find a balance between noise reduction and image preservation.
 
## How does Imagenomic Noiseware work?
 
Imagenomic Noiseware is a plugin that works within Photoshop or Photoshop Elements. It uses a sophisticated algorithm that analyzes the image and detects the noise level and characteristics. It then applies a customized noise filter that targets the noise while preserving the image details. It also offers a range of options for adjusting the noise profile, sharpening, edge enhancement, and gamma correction.
 
Imagenomic Noiseware has several advantages over other noise reduction tools. It is fast, easy to use, and effective. It can handle different types of noise, such as luminance noise, color noise, impulse noise, and JPEG artifacts. It can also adapt to different image sizes, resolutions, and formats. It has a user-friendly interface that allows you to preview the results in real time and compare them with the original image.
